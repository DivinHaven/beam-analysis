# Beam Analysis

## Objectives of the mini-project

Realize a simple GUI to analyse the beam profile data (see `beam_profile.ipynb` exercice). The app is expected to have the following capabilities:

1. Import data. Optionnally you can use a QDialog with open file features
2. Plot data using `pyqtgraph`
3. Fit the data and plot the fitted curve
4. Print the waist value and any other useful info in a list widget

The project should be tracked with `git` and posted on Github (on our `OPTIQ-2024` organisation).
